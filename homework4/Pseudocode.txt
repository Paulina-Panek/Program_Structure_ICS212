define a pointer to record called temp_prev
define a pointer to record called temp_new
define an int called value

if (start is equal NULL)
    allocate a heap space and store its address into start
    copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in start
    copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in start
    copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in start
    copy from NULL to next in the record whose address is in start
    
else
    allocate a heap space and store its address into temp_new
    copy from accountno in the record whose address is in start to value
    
    while (value is less than uaccountno)
        copy address from next of the record
        
    if (value is greater than uaccountno)
        allocate a heap space and store its address into next
 
    else
