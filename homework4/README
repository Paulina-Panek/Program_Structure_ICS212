Write the pseudocode for the function addRecord with the following features:

must add/insert a new record into the list so that all records are sorted in ascending order by account number.

It must accept a duplicate account number.

e.g., when you are inserting "1001" to the list of "1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1008, 1010", the result will be "1000, 1001, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1008, 1010".

There must be no use of any C code (also no curly braces) in the pseudocode

You may ONLY use the vocabulary from the list below

The functioning code will be about 30 lines. Pseudocode with more than 40 lines is not acceptable.
