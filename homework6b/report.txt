The Source Code Control System (SCCS) is a collection of UNIX system commands that track
updates done to the code. It consists of SCCS commands and SCCS files. The idea behind it
is that it is not efficient to keep source files of every created versions as a lot of
the code will overlap from version to version. Instead, SCCS keeps only the original source
code and images of changes done to it in successive versions.

SCCS can put a file under the SCCS control, retrieve the desired version of software, store
information on who, when, and why updated the file, identify the version of the retrieved
file, create new releases or ensure only one person is editing a file at a given time.

SCCS was created in the 1970s for IBM and was later adapted for UNIX and it was the first 
source control system. Nowadays, it is almost obsolete as more modern tools replaced it.

Reviewed commands:
sccs create - places file under SCCS control, creates a history file and a read-only
              original file

sccs edit - checks out a writable version for edits

sccs delta - checks in changes, will prompt the user to comment on the changes

sccs get - retrieves a read-only copy of the file, can be used to get a particular
           revision of a file

sccs prt - provides history of the file
