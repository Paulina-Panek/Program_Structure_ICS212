The Source Code Control System (SCCS) is a collection of UNIX system commands that track
updates done to the code. It consists of SCCS commands and SCCS files. The idea behind it
is that it is not efficient to keep source files of every created versions as a lot of
the code will overlap from version to version. Instead, SCCS keeps only the original source
code and images of changes done to it in successive versions.

SCCS can put a file under the SCCS control, retrieve the desired version of software, store
information on who, when, and why updated the file, identify the version of the retrieved
file, create new releases or ensure only one person is editing a file at a given time.

SCCS was created in the 1970s for IBM and was later adapted for UNIX and it was the first 
source control system. Nowadays, it is almost obsolete as more modern tools replaced it.
