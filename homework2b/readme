Exercise 1:
Write a function, halfstring, which creates a new string which skips every second characters of the first string.
For example: "John Smith" would become "Jh mt"

Exercise2:
Write a main function that uses at least 5 different string functions from the library (e.g., strlen, strncpy, etc).
This is a creative exercise. You can make up any combination of functions based on a user-input string.
